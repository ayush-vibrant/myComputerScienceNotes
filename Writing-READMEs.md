### Writing-READMEs

 ***
 
#### Basic Markdown

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to valid HTML for viewing on GitHub.

##### Paragraphs

```
Paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of 

consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.

```
##### Headings

You can create a heading by adding one or more `#` symbols your heading text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the heading.

```
# The largest heading (an <h1> tag)
## The second largest heading (an <h1> tag)
...
###### The 6th largest heading (an <h6> tag)
 
```
##### Blockquotes

You can indicate [blockquotes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) with a `>`.

```
